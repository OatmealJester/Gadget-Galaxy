/* border-image-source sets the image to be used as the border. 
    The linear-gradient(to Right, red, orange, yellow, green, blue) function 
    creates a linear gradient that starts from red and transitions to 
    from left to right. 
    The border-image-slice property specifies where to slice the border image. */

/* Transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
    is added to smoothly change the size of the footer over a period of 0.3 seconds.
    When the mouse hovers over the footer, transform: scale(1.05);
    increases the size of the footer by 5%.
this will increase the size of the footer in all directions. 
To grow in a specific direction,
you can use scaleX() or scaleY() instead of scale().  */
